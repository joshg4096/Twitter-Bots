## Background

Reports have shown that nearly 48 million accounts on Twitter are bots, and yet Twitter does not distinguish between bot accounts and real users. Therefore, bots have the ability to deceive real users. Bots have been found posting and responding to political tweets, and in 2016, about one-fifth of tweets about the U.S election came from a group of bot accounts. These bots influenced the content that real users saw on their timeline, altering the public perception current events and political figures. For example, bots may show artificial support or anger over the tweet of a politician or content of a news article, while other bots may simply spread misinformation.

## Problem Statement

Given features associated with a Twitter account, accurately determine whether the account is run by a bot.

## Scope

This work serves only to provide a true/false answer as to whether an account is run by a bot. We do not attempt to determine what purpose a bot serves, whether a bot acts maliciously, or if the associated account should be terminated.
